BrightPath University Academic & Operations Action Plan 2025–2026
Aligned to the Strategic Plan 2025–2030
1. Introduction
The BrightPath University Academic & Operations Action Plan 2025–2026 translates the highlevel priorities contained in the Strategic Plan 2025–2030 into concrete, timebound initiatives. It focuses on the first full year of implementation and identifies the major projects, activities, and process improvements that will be undertaken across the institution.
This Action Plan serves several purposes:
• It provides a clear set of commitments for the 2025–2026 period, aligned to the five strategic objectives (S1–S5).
• It clarifies ownership and accountability for each action by identifying lead units and responsible officers.
• It defines measurable targets and timelines, supporting monitoring, evaluation, and continuous improvement.
• It creates a shared understanding of priorities across academic and professional services units.
The plan is organized by Strategic Objective. Under each objective, a series of actions are listed with associated Action IDs, descriptions, ownership, timelines, key performance indicators (KPIs), and current status. While the status for most initiatives at the start of 2025–2026 is “Planned”, this will be updated as implementation proceeds.
Progress against this Action Plan will be reviewed quarterly by the Strategic Plan Implementation Group and reported to the University Executive and Council. Annual updates will be incorporated into subsequent action plans, allowing for refinement based on performance and emerging needs.

3. Monitoring, Review, and Next Steps
This Action Plan is intended to be dynamic and responsive. Throughout 2025–2026:
• Quarterly reviews will track progress on all actions, updating status fields (e.g., “In progress”, “Completed”, “Deferred”) and noting any barriers or support required.
• Annual evaluation will compare achieved outcomes against the KPIs and targets, informing revisions to the next cycle of the Action Plan.
• Stakeholder feedback, including input from students, staff, employers, and community partners, will be systematically collected and used to refine initiatives.
As BrightPath University progresses through the 2025–2030 strategic period, subsequent annual action plans will build on the foundations laid in this document, ensuring sustained alignment with the Strategic Plan and continuous improvement in institutional performance and impact.
